Here should be an example from computational electro-magnetics (CEM).
This is a joint prohect between Prof. Tempone and Prof. Bagci groups.
The geometry of the shape is uncertain. We research how this uncertainty propagate to the solution (e.h. complete electro-magnetics scattered fields).
We pre-generate various meshes for the sphere (later plan consider other shapes). 
The CEM code is fortran code provided by Hakan Bagci and his group.
Hakan provide to us few object files and interface of the main black boc procedure , which should be called from MLMC code.
